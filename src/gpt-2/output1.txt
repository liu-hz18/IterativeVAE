======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
what are you talking about ?
it 's not a problem i know
you can see the map in the window
i 'll bet you 're in a hurry
i know how to UNknown your map
i 'll bet you 'll be all right there
i have a map of everything you 've done and who you 've killed
i 'd like to see your files
we will be able to locate these files
the UNknown will take them to your new headquarters
you wo n't have to go to UNknown
it will be all right
you 're all right here
i 'll get you out
i 'll get you both out
what do you want me to do ?
take me back right now
i 'll take you both out now
i 'll take you both out then you 'll be safe again
that 's not what i said
this is all i have to say
what do you think i told you ?
that i 'm in love with you
and that if you were to let go i 'd kill you
i do n't need to convince you right now
the problem is you do n't really know what i mean
that the only reason you were there is because your heart told you to
that 's what it was
it 's the first time since i came to UNknown you really trusted me and you let me go
i 'm sorry it was so hard
i ca n't think about that
looks like i 'm gonna have to get back here
what 's the matter with you ?
you wo n't like this
i 'd love to tell you what i 've been up to
my business with mr UNknown is n't over
i have a deal with mr UNknown to return to UNknown and to give a new name to the empire
and if you 'll take this job ?
you wo n't like it either
looks like i 'm gonna have to get back to UNknown
i 'll take you both out
what do you mean 'cause i 've already agreed to this job ?
that 's what i 'm going to tell the people of UNknown
no he 's not going to tell anybody else
no one ever told you that you 'd be a UNknown of this kind again
that people would still be afraid of you
then you wo n't be
he 'll get you !
they 'll stop you from being here
do you think that 'll work ?
we 're here to be a part of a UNknown
i 'll tell you this one thing
we 'll always be part of UNknown
i 'll tell you this one thing
you 're in a lot of trouble
she ca n't go back to UNknown
he was a valuable member of the UNknown family
that 's really all the trouble there is
it 's just that you can't do anything about it
looks like we 're gonna have to come back there
what 's going on in UNknown ?
this is so strange to me
i told you the first time i met you
a year ago i met you in the casino in UNknown
we 're going back now to UNknown
you 've been a good friend and it 's my great pleasure to welcome you to UNknown
it takes a lot of courage to be a UNknown of a large empire of power
this world must be ours
your brother 's alive and well
we can have the money back !
we 've got a deal to make with mr UNknown but the big one is not going to happen
what about those papers from UNknown ?
i 'll tell you what 's right
no we wo n't make this deal
i have a solution for both of us
i 'll tell you the deal right now
if you 're so confident that you can be UNknown that it will be the UNknown who get to keep it
well we 'll just have to keep it
that will be the UNknown people
no i 'm not saying that
i want it back !
that 's a whole new world
you want us to stay and you tell us to kill UNknown !
you wanna make that deal ?
well you got a bad feeling about what she 's doing !
he UNknown is out there !
i 've got a deal for him
he was a UNknown of a large empire of power
they must be happy to have an old UNknown like you
i wo n't let UNknown get away
you ca n't let UNknown get away
we 're going through that same UNknown again now
i 'm not going to let UNknown get away
but there are two things out in the world that need you
======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
the second verse reads as follows
the first verse is the same but there are two verses in each line that give the author's name
now we do not know who is the real author of this poem
so we now have to determine the identity of the real author of this poem
but the question of the authenticity of this poem does not concern us now
in the first verse it is the author of the verses and in the second verse it is the author of the verses
in the first verse it is the author of the verses
in the second verse it is the author of the verses
in the first verse it is the author of the verses and in the second verse it is the author of the verses
i am the third verse of the first poem
but in the second verse the author is the writer
i am the first verse of the second poem
is this the author of the verses and the editor of the poems ?
and in the third verse the writer is the author
how in the name of all that is holy in the heavens and on earth
is the person who wrote the poem UNknown the same individual who wrote the first verse of the first poem ?
if this poem is the same individual who wrote the first verse of the first poem then we must assume that this poem was the author of the first verse of the first poem and the author of the second verse of the second poem
the author of the first poem could not be the author of the second poem because in the second verse the author is the writer
you will not be able to prove that the author can be proven by the fact that the author of the first poem is the same writer who wrote the second poem
i do not deny that the author of the first poem is the author of the second poem
the author is the author of the first poem
the author of the first is the author of the second
the author is the author of the first poem
therefore in the first verse it is not the author of the second verse of the first poem
it is not the writer of the verse
you will not be able to prove that the author can be proved by the fact that the author of the first poem is not the author of the second verse of the first poem
you will not be able to prove that the author can be proven by the fact that the author of the first poem is not the author of the second verse of the first poem
i am the first verse of the second poem
i am the author of the second verse of the second poem
the author is the author of the first poem
the only doubt is that of the poet is it not
the author is the author of the first poem
it is not the author of the verse
i am the author of the second verse of the second poem
i am the author of the second verse of the second poem
i am the author of the first poem
this is not the author or the author of the second verse of the first poem
i am the author of the first verse of the second poem
i am the author of the second verse of the second poem
i am the author of the first poem
the only doubt is that the author of the first poem cannot be proven by the fact that the author of the first poem is not the author of the second verse of the first poem
the author of the second poem cannot be proven by the fact that it is not the author of the first verse of the second poem
the author of the first poem cannot be proven by the fact that it is not the author of the second verse of the second poem
the author of the first poem cannot be proven by the fact that it is not the author of the second verse of the first poem
no man can be proven to be the author by the fact that the author of the second poem is not the author of the first poem
to prove any one to be the author of the second verse of the first poem
it is not the author of the first verse but the author of the second verse
to prove any one to be the author of the 2nd verse of the first poem
i am the author of the 1st verse of the 2nd poem
now it is for the first poet to prove himself
now it is for the author himself to prove himself
is all i am the 1st verse of the 2nd poem
and that thou mayest be exalted above the dust
i am the 2nd verse of the 1st poem
and the author of the 1st verse is the author of the 2nd verse
now we have the author of the first verse of the 2nd poem
and now it is the author of the 1st verse of the 2nd poem
but the author is still the author and the author the author is still the author of the 1st verse of the 1st poem
he is the author of the 1st verse of the 1st poem
to prove that the author is the author of the 2nd
